FPGA-SPECIFIC DISCLAIMERS
================================================================================

HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE:
This HDL design is provided for educational and prototyping purposes. Before
deploying to production hardware, you must:

1. TIMING CLOSURE: Verify timing constraints are met for your target FPGA
   device and clock frequencies. Failing to meet timing can cause data
   corruption or system instability.

2. RESOURCE UTILIZATION: Confirm the design fits within your device's resource
   budget (LUTs, FFs, BRAMs, DSPs) and does not cause routing congestion.

3. FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION: Perform comprehensive simulation and hardware
   testing under realistic operating conditions, including corner cases and
   stress testing.

4. CLOCK DOMAIN CROSSING: Verify all CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) logic is
   correctly implemented with proper synchronizers and metastability handling.

5. POWER ANALYSIS: Ensure dynamic and static power consumption is within your
   board's power delivery capabilities and thermal limits.

6. SIGNAL INTEGRITY: Validate high-speed interfaces (Ethernet, PCIe) meet
   signal integrity requirements (impedance matching, termination, layout).

XILINX IP DISCLAIMER:
This project may instantiate or reference Xilinx IP cores (AXI Ethernet
Subsystem, TEMAC, etc.) which are subject to Xilinx's End User License
Agreement (EULA). You must have appropriate Xilinx licenses to synthesize
and implement designs using these IP cores.

ETHERNET COMPLIANCE:
This design processes Ethernet packets but does not implement full IEEE 802.3
compliance. For production use in networking equipment, ensure compliance with
relevant standards and regulations.

HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING NOTICE:
This design is intended for educational demonstration of FPGA techniques
applicable to low-latency trading systems. Production HFT systems require:
- Extensive validation and testing
- Risk management and circuit breakers
- Regulatory compliance (SEC, CFTC, exchange rules)
- Professional code review and audit trails

NO LIABILITY:
The authors assume no liability for financial losses, hardware damage, or
regulatory violations resulting from use of this design.
